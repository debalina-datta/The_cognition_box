## About The Author

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/author.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>


Hello! Iâ€™m Debalina! Currently a doctoral student in biological sciences, I find myself amidst a new-found ocean of knowledge all around me. 
Although the sail is set in a definite direction to prove myself as an able researcher, on my way, I often find myself at crossroads of 
subjects and discover new avenues of scientific facts that are illuminating. I have realised there is so much to know in this world and 
how important it is, that it be shared with all. 


## About The Cognition Box

This blog is such an outlet where I will be sharing some interesting science stories and facts. Please do browse through the blog.
Do not worry if you do not have much prior knowledge of science (especially biology). The posts are written about the living systems
and beyond, but with simple explanations. I sincerely hope that you have fun reading them! 
Thanks for visiting!
